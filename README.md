# Himba_HLA
Consensus_allele_calcs: takes in GenDX, Omixon, and HLA_LA outputs and comes up with the consensus alleles
Sim_score: takes the pairs lists and the consensus alleles and creates similarity scores for all the real pairs and equivalent number of random pairs
Number_of_children_and_paternity_assertions: some random work that created the full pairs list with the number of children (verified through pedigree) per pair.  This Rmd also created "sex_and_number_children_inds_in_pairs" which has the number of children and sex of each individual
